# CollidingWinds

This repository contains animated visualizations of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of colliding stellar winds in massive binary systems, produced as part of my master thesis. The simulations were performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code **[PHANTOM](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom)** (Price et al. 2018) and visualised using the **[SPLASH](https://github.com/danieljprice/splash)** tool (Price 2007).
